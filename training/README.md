# Training
The training is based on the [turbofan dataset from NASA](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/\#turbofan). A recurrent neural network is built to perform a regression task predicting the remaining useful life of turbofan devices. See the [jupyter notebook]() for more details.
